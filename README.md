When I started working on the project I concentrated on topics I wasn't familiar with. In order to learn them I've created the repository demo (https://github.com/pavelhalavach/demo). 
While I was focused on applying functionality that was previously unknown to me, I didn't keep track of my code and if I made commits, they were not informative and rare.
And at some point my demo project became big enough to rewrite it from scratch.

In this repository I tried to show that I know how to use git and how commits and pull requests could look like approximately.
I attached my demo project here to demonstrate that the project was not generated by AI in one day.
